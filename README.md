To start:
  - Run GameServer.java
  - Run GameClient.java or any other derivative of GameClient
This is only a temporary way to turn on the server/client

To start:
   - Running main.Main.main() will allow you to create a server and attach a client to the server on that IP
   - for a connection in a single computer, use 127.0.0.1 for IP; otherwise, use the IP specified in cmd.
For future:
   - Game will be started by one client running HostGame.main() and another running 
     JoinGame.main() and enter the Host's LAN IP.
The former is for testing. The latter is for the final.

Now it is all part of Main, and will soon be moved to Game with a host/join enum.
